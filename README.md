# ctrlC
CtrlC is a mod for Cities: Skylines 2 that allows players to effortlessly copy, save, and reuse custom-built infrastructure such as interchanges, parks, and other city assets. With CtrlC, users can streamline their city-building experience by creating reusable prefabs, making large-scale construction projects faster and more efficient.

Whether you're copying a simple intersection or a complex city park, CtrlC provides an intuitive way to manage and redeploy your favorite creations with ease.


# Learn About This Project
I'm currently working on cleaning up the code and keeping it well-commented and thoroughly documented to make it easy for anyone to understand how this mod works.

The goal is to ensure it's accessible to those who want to learn how to build mods or for developers who wish to reuse parts of the code in their own projects.
