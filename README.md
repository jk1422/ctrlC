## TODO-List:

### Top priority:  <sup>(needs fix before publish)</sup>
- **better explanation of the UI:** The UI isn't very clear to understand so adding tooltips on hovering might be useful
- **make the toggle button work:** The toggle button for toggling between single and circle selection doesn't work yet. This needs to be fixed.  
- **Make bulding extensions unselecteble/select whole building:** When selecting a extension of the building, we should instead select the parent building.
- ~~**Copy without any selection:** Just check length of the selection lists before copying.~~

### Medium priority:  <sup>(needs fix, but not prioritized)</sup>
- **Select whole parks:** When trying to select a park, the subobjects are selected instead of the whole park.
- **Burstify copy functions**

### Low priority:  <sup>(Issues that aren't significant/only happens when using the mod for unintended things)</sup>


## Note:
This is not the final code. It needs to be cleaned up.
